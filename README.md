Using the GitHub repository search API (https://developer.github.com/v3/search/#search-repositories) build site that displays repository info for a query.  The site should be a single page that allows for text searching and the option to sort by either relevance (score), or the number of stars.  The search results should contain the repository name, description, number of stars, language, and the owners name. You can include more info if you wish.  You must use a JavaScript framework to build this page but it can be anything you like with the exception of jQuery.
